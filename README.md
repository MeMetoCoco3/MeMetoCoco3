# Hi, I`m Vidal
I'm an aspiring backend software engineer currently working full-time in logistics, on a mission to turn my career in a fulfilling direction.

I've been programming for a year and a half using Python, and I've loved every bit of it. I’ve developed numerous small projects to deepen my skills, culminating in <a href="https://github.com/code50/148576190/tree/main/Proyecto">Hamzahub</a>, a Warehouse Management System built with the MySQL connector API and Tkinter for the GUI. This project taught me a lot about database design, user interface design and how to shape the fetched data to be processed adequately.

Please check my other repositories and let me know points in which i could get better, I would greatly appreciate it!

Currently, I'm diving into Django to bring some of my ideas to life, and I’m excited about the possibilities it offers!

I also enjoy programming in Go, especially working with goroutines, channels, and concurrency patterns. Additionally, I have a passion for C and the low-level programming experience it provides; I even started a game project using Raylib!

I’m always eager to collaborate and learn from others, so feel free to reach out if you’re interested in working together!
